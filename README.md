# Student_Report_Card_Managenment_System
 A pure c++ program with file handling to manange data of student's results.

I built this program remembering the similar projects that I used to work on during my intermediate.

Built from scratch this program is used to manage student's results in a school, using the concepts of OOP and file handling in c++. The changed data is then stored into the .dat file which is used to manage the data even after the application is closed and used later for management purpose. 

If you wish to try this program you need to download this [file](https://github.com/KA1PE5H/Student_Report_Card_Managenment_System/blob/main/STUDEN~1.exe) and this [file](https://github.com/KA1PE5H/Student_Report_Card_Managenment_System/blob/main/student.dat) and this program should work in your system.
